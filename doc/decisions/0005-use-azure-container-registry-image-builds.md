## Status

In review

## Context

<!-- The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision. -->
Not everyone has a local _Docker_ environment. Through AZD we have two easy options in building container images: 
1. Local [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) build of the images
2. Remote [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-tutorial-quick-task) build.
